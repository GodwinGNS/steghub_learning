# Step 0 - Preparing prerequisites


In order to complete this project you will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS.

If you do not have an AWS account - go back to Project 1 Step 0 to sign in to AWS free tier account ans create a new EC2 Instance of t2.nano family with Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (HVM) image. Remember, you can have multiple EC2 instances, but make sure you STOP the ones you are not working with at the moment to save available free hours.

Hint: In previous projects we used different tools to connect to an EC2 instance, but if you do not want to install or launch anything outside of AWS, you can open youc CLI straight from Web Console in AWS.


Our so arm in this project is to  implement a simple Book Register web form using MEAN stack.
