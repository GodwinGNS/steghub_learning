## NANO EDITOR AND BASIC COMMAND


### Launching nano

​Okay, let’s roll! Here’s a shortcut to opening your terminal and launching nano.

Press ctrl+alt+t


Creating the file

nano note.txt

Typing and saving
​
Let’s type in something like this:

​8 AM-        Lunch

1 PM-        Tea

5 PM-        DinnerTo save the above text file 

press ctrl+o then Enter key and you’re done.    

Exiting

​All done well and now we might just exit and make the day here. Press ctrl+x and your program exits.  


Moving up and down
Press ctrl+n to move down

Press ctrl+p to move up ​Hard to consume that shortcut? Take ‘n’ as in next and ‘p’ as previous. Tada! And so on for the remaining down there and use your own acronym too. It helps!  

Letter and word traversing
​To move your cursor one word at a time press ctrl+space and the reverse of moving back one word at a time is esc+space.For individual letters; ctrl+f as in forward and ctrl+b in reverse

Well, then what about the end and beginning of the current line? Much needed because you might want to edit the last line first or vice versa. Press –


ctrl+e to bring your cursor to the end of the current line and ctrl+a to the beginning of the current line.

Copy and paste
​To select the text; position your cursor  (let’s say) at 1 PM, press esc+shift+a.

Cut and paste
``ctrl+k``

Find words 
``W Where is``

And in case you wish to escape from finding utility all you’ve to do is press ctrl+c and it’ll be canceled.  

Find and replace
 ``esc+r``
 
 Extras
 
 Maybe you want a clean interface as you start up nano? Pass in -x as an additional argument. So for the above note-taking file, you’d do it this way to get the output as below. nano -x note.txt
